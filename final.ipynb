    "With a rising concern for the world's health and climate change, all things energy are a big topic. Researchers are finding the best ways to harness renewable energy efficiently, companies are turning away from the use of fossil fuels, people are buying electric cars, and electric people are starting to rely on their electric companies a little less, by installing their own solar panels. With all this happening, there are still large providers in every state that a huge portion of the United States rely on to get their electricity, and over the years, their means of obtaining and distributing said electricity may vary, whether they start relying more on nuclear plants, solar panels, or other more renewable sources, but how has this, among many other obstables, investments, failures, or more impacted the price of electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "To dive deeper into understanding the pricing of electricity throughout the United States, will take a look at the U.S Department of Energy's data on the average price of electricity in each US state from the years 1990 - 2020 in their dataset titled \"Average Price (Cents/kilowatthour) by State by Provider, 1990-2020\". By taking a look at this data, we hope to find possible trends in prices accross the nation, in specific states or regions, and across time.\n",

    "This phase consists of finding a data set. This can be done by searching online and finding links to datasets, or finding downloads to save to your working directory. In the below example, I searched data.gov for an aggregate of datasets published by the Department of Energy. By doing so, I found a link to a json file that contains a json object of datasets collected and maintained by the Dept. of Energy. Once this json link was acquired, I used the urllib.request and json libraries to open and read in the json file to a json object. This takes the contents of that file and stores them in a variable named 'data' that I can later manipulate. Using this json object, I then went through all of the datasets until I found the one that I wanted to use, which I did by searching for the object with the title \"Annual Electricity Price by State\". I knew this was the title of the information I wanted beceause I looked throught the object manually to find the dataset I would like to access, but there were many more interesting datasets that can be used for further exploration. Once I found this specific dataset, I parsed through it to find the url of the excel spreadsheet that contained the data and used df.read_excel to read it in, making sure to specify which line the column headers are on. This stored the dataset in a pandas dataframe, which acts as a table with multiple rows and columns of the data that can be easily manipulated to further explore the data.\n",

Categorical data on the other hand, is data that takes a value from a finite set, and can be further brokwn down into nominal data and ordinal data. Nominal data has values with names or categories, like in marital status or color, where ordinal data has a sort of ordering over the values, like in ratings (\"strongly like\", \"like\", \"neutral\", \"strongly dislike\").
